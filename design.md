#### What additional properties did you add to your models and why?

Apart from the ones specifically needed for the game logic, I added `layout` to the Board class in order to debug the code with a visual representation of the game's boards.

#### What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the new game logic?

My main trouble implementing the game logic it's been more about things that are not related with this project's subject. Learning about Google App Engine it's been interesting and fun with all the videos. Where I have spent more time in this project, is trying to write DRY and clever code for `check_hit` and `add_ships` methods in `Board` class and I'm not happy with the result.

Apart from that, with the very useful help of the **Guess a number** game code example and **Google App Engine** documentation, the rest it's been easy, GAE it's a very powerful tool, I feel now like as soon as I have any good idea for an API, I could code it in a very short time.
